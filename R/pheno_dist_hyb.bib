abstract = {Mate recognition systems (MRSs) play a major role in sexual selection and speciation, yet few studies have analysed both male and female components in detail. Here, female preference functions have been characterized for the tettigoniid bushcricket Ephippiger ephippiger, and the inheritance of male song and female preference functions followed in crosses between subspecies. Songs are disproportionately determined by sex-linked genes. However, there is no evidence for a role of maternally derived sex-linked genes in female preference or of maternal effects. At the genetic level, there is a mismatch between peak preferences and male song, consistent with an evolutionary history of persistent directional preferences. Such a pattern of inheritance could contribute to the process of speciation via the evolution of new MRSs.},

abstract = {1.The sympatric, genetically compatible treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis and H. femoralis , were artificially crossed (reciprocally) and the F1 hybrid progeny raised to sexual maturity in the laboratory. The calls of males and selective phonotaxis of females were studied.2.Male hybrids began calling about seven months after the cross was made. The temporal properties of the vocalizations were intermediate, more similar to one or the other of the calls of the parental species, or unique to hybrids. Pulse period (pulse-repetition rate) was the most stereotyped temporal property and was more similar to that in the calls of H. femoralis than H. chrysoscelis. Dominant frequency of the calls of hybrids and both parental species was typically between 2 and 3 kHz.3.In two-stimulus playback experiments, F1 female hybrids were selectively attracted to hybrid calls in preference to those of H. chrysoscelis. Females did not prefer hybrid calls over those of H. femoralis , probably because of an overlap in pulse period and a significant difference in the total amount of acoustic stimulation. When these factors were eliminated or reduced by presentation of synthetic calls, female hybrids chose a stimulus with a pulse period typical of hybrids in preference to a call with a pulse period typical of H. femoralis. 4.There were no differences in the call structure nor in the selective phonotaxis of F1 hybrids of the reciprocal crosses, thus indicating that sex-link-age and maternal effects are probably not involved in the genetic specification of the acoustic communication system.5.The behavioral coupling (with respect to pulse period) demonstrated in this study and in crickets is consistent with the predictions of the ‘genetic coupling' hypothesis, which postulates that both signal generating and recognition mechanisms share common circuitry specified by the same genes. The results of these behavioral studies are sufficiently encouraging to warrant neurophysiological, anatomical and genetic experiments that can provide direct tests of the hypothesis.},

abstract = {The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus was used as a model organism to look at effects of crossing distance on fitness and to investigate the genetic mechanisms responsible. Crosses were conducted between 12 pairs of populations spanning a broad range of both geographic distance (5 m to 2007 km) and genetic distance (0.2{\%} to 22.3{\%} sequence divergence for a 606-bp segment of the mitochondrial COI gene). For each pair of populations, three fitness components (hatching number, survivorship number, and metamorphosis number) were measured in up to 16 cohorts including parentals, reciprocal F-1, F-2, F-3, and first-generation backcross hybrids. Comparisons of each set of cohorts allowed estimation of within- and between-locus gene interaction. Relative to parentals, F-1 hybrids showed a trend toward increased fitness, with no correspondence with population divergence, and a decrease in variance, which in some cases correlated with population divergence. In sharp contrast, F-2 hybrids had a decrease in fitness and an increase in variance that both corresponded to population divergence. Genetic interpretation of these patterns suggests that both the beneficial effects of dominance and the detrimental effects of breaking up coadaptation are magnified by increasing evolutionary distance between populations. Because there is no recombination in T. californicus females, effects of recombination can be assessed by comparing F-1 hybrid males and females backcrossed to parentals. Both recombinant and nonrecombinant backcross hybrids showed a decline in fitness correlated with population divergence, indicating that segregation among chromosomes contributes to the breakup of coadaptation. Although there was no difference in mean fitness between the two backcross types, recombinational backcrosses showed greater variance for fitness than nonrecombinational backcrosses, suggesting that the breakup of parental gene ombinations within chromosomes has both beneficial and detrimental effects.},

abstract = {* Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio. * However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. * In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. * Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and lnx¯ (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with lnx¯ overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. * Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Females of two Drosophila virilis group species, D. virilis and D. montana, have different requirements for the courting males. In the present study we have examined species differences in female receptivity and male courtship song requirement using females' acceptance signal instead of copulation for measuring female readiness to mate. Behavior of D. virilis and D. montana females and F-1 and backcross hybrid females was observed in a single-pair courtships with D. virilis and D. montana males and normal and wingless (mute) F-1 hybrid males. D. virilis females were very receptive and they commonly accepted the courtship of males unable to produce courtship song. D. montana females, on the contrary, had a low receptivity and these females accepted the courting male only after hearing his song. Interspecific F-1 and backcross (BCm) females resembled D. virilis more than D. montana in their receptivity. These females, however, resembled D. montana in their song requirement. These findings suggest that female song requirement and female receptivity are determined by different genetic factors.},

abstract = {Female mating behavior plays a fundamental role in the divergent evolution of mate recognition systems that may lead to speciation. Despite this important role, the phenotypic and genetic bases of female mating behavior remain poorly understood. In this study, I examine the shape of the female acoustic preference function and estimate values for pulse rate preference in two species of Hawaiian crickets, Laupala kohalensis and L. paranigra. In addition, I examine how preference differences are inherited in hybrid crosses between these species. Females expressed unimodal preference functions and were generally more attracted to pulse rates characterizing their own species. Unimodal preference functions also characterized F1 and backcross generations, with hybrid females expressing preferences for intermediate pulse rates. Pulse rate preferences segregated in the backcross generation. Mean pulse rate preference matched mean pulse rate in both parental and hybrid generations. Based on F1 hybrids and segregation patterns in backcross females, I show that changes in both signal and receiver components of the mate recognition system are consistent with a multilocus model of change through incremental steps. The results therefore suggest that ancestors of the current species also expressed unimodal preference functions and that changes in acoustic communication signals occurred through shifts in mean pulse rates and pulse rate preferences among populations.},

abstract = {The endemic cichlid fishes in Lake Victoria are a model system for speciation through adaptive radiation. Although the evolution of the sex-determination system may also play a role in speciation, little is known about the sex-determination system of Lake Victoria cichlids. To understand the evolution of the sex-determination system in these fish, we performed cytogenetic analysis in 11 cichlid species from Lake Victoria. B chromosomes, which are present in addition to standard chromosomes, were found at a high prevalence rate (85{\%}) in these cichlids. In one species, B chromosomes were female-specific. Cross-breeding using females with and without the B chromosomes demonstrated that the presence of the B chromosomes leads to a female-biased sex ratio in this species. Although B chromosomes were believed to be selfish genetic elements with little effect on phenotype and to lack protein-coding genes, the present study provides evidence that B chromosomes have a functional effect on female sex determination. FISH analysis using a BAC clone containing B chromosome DNA suggested that the B chromosomes are derived from sex chromosomes. Determination of the nucleotide sequences of this clone (104.5 kb) revealed the presence of several protein-coding genes in the B chromosome, suggesting that B chromosomes have the potential to contain functional genes. Because some sex chromosomes in amphibians and arthropods are thought to be derived from B chromosomes, the B chromosomes in Lake Victoria cichlids may represent an evolutionary transition toward the generation of sex chromosomes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Yoshida et al.},

abstract = {Haldane's Rule (HR), which states that 'when in the offspring of two different animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterozygous (heterogametic) sex', is one of the most general patterns in speciation biology. We review the literature of the past 15 years and find that among the similar to 85 new studies, many consider taxa that traditionally have not been the focus for HR investigations. The new studies increased to nine, the number of 'phylogenetically independent' groups that comply with HR. They continue to support the dominance and faster-male theories as explanations for HR, although due to increased reliance on indirect data (from, for example, differential introgression of cytoplasmic versus chromosomal loci in natural hybrid zones) unambiguous novel results are rare. We further highlight how research on organisms with sex determination systems different from those traditionally considered may lead to more insight in the underlying causes of HR. In particular, haplodiploid organisms provide opportunities for testing specific predictions of the dominance and faster X chromosome theory, and we present new data that show that the faster-male component of HR is supported in hermaphrodites, suggesting that genes involved in male function may evolve faster than those expressed in the female function.

Typically, sexual interactions among species are studied in secondary contact zones of closely related species (hybrid zones) or between invasive and native species, whereas hybridization between sympatric congeners has received little attention. Here, we present a study on the hybridization potential of two grasshopper species, Chorthippus parallelus and Chorthippus montanus, which occur sympatric in large parts of Eurasia. We performed a mate choice experiment with specimens from an area of local parapatry in northwestern Germany. Most copulations were conspecific, but males of both species and females of C. parallelus were indiscriminate in their mate choice, while females of C. montanus clearly preferred conspecific males. Although these results suggest asymmetric introgression, a no-choice hybridization experiment revealed that hybridization is possible in both directions. The hatching success of the hybrids was intermediate between the parental species. Female hybrids showed no clear mate preferences, indicating that back crossing in both directions is possible in principle, but the fertility of the hybrids and the fitness of the F2 generation remain unknown. Our study suggests that hybridization between sympatric species might occur more often than assumed. It might affect the ecology and local distribution of animals in a similar way as competition does.},

To address this empirical gap, we compiled data from 233 crosses in which traits were measured in a common environment for two parent taxa and their F 1 hybrids. We find that individual traits in F 1 s are halfway between the parental midpoint and one parental value. Considering pairs of traits together, a hybrid's bivariate phenotype tends to resemble one parent (parent bias) about 50{\%} more than the other, while also exhibiting a similar magnitude of mismatch due to different traits having dominance in conflicting directions. Using data from an experimental field planting of recombinant hybrid sunflowers, we illustrate that parent bias improves fitness, whereas mismatch reduces fitness. Our study has three major conclusions. First, hybrids are not phenotypically intermediate but rather exhibit substantial mismatch. Second, dominance is likely determined by the idiosyncratic evolutionary trajectories of individual traits and populations. Finally, selection against hybrids likely results from selection against both intermediate and mismatched phenotypes.},

abstract = {Abstract The grasshoppers Chorthippus brunneus and Chorthippus jacobsi are highly differentiated for male mating signals, and form a mosaic hybrid zone in northern Spain. At some sites within this zone, many hybrids are observed. At others, few hybrids are observed. Such bimodal sites may reflect recent contacts between parental genotypes, or local variation in levels of assortative mating or selection against hybrids. Playback of 12 parental and F1 male songs to 296 parental and hybrid females revealed positive assortative preferences in C. brunneus and C. jacobsi females, supporting a direct role of male mating signals in female choice. However, all female genotypic classes showed reduced responsiveness to F1 male songs. Such sexual selection against hybrids is consistent with the narrow cline width observed in the field for song characters relative to morphology. These results have implications for the genetic structure of the hybrid zone and for models of speciation by reinforcement.},

@article{Rieseberg1999,
abstract = {The production of extreme or 'transgressive' phenotypes in segregating hybrid populations has been speculated to contribute to niche divergence of hybrid lineages. Here, we assess the frequency of transgressive segregation in hybrid populations, describe its genetic basis and discuss the factors that best predict its occurrence. From a survey of 171 studies that report phenotypic variation in segregating hybrid populations, we show that transgression is the rule rather than the exception. In fact, 155 of the 171 studies (91{\%}) report at least one transgressive trait, and 44{\%} of 1229 traits examined were transgressive. Transgression occurred most frequently in intraspecific crosses involving inbred, domesticated plant populations, and least frequently in interspecific crosses between outbred, wild animal species. Quantitative genetic studies of plant hybrids consistently point to the action of complementary genes as the primary cause of transgression, although overdominance and epistasis also contribute. Complementary genes appear to be common for most traits, with the possible exception of those with a history of disruptive selection. These results lend credence to the view that hybridization may provide the raw material for rapid adaptation and provide a simple explanation for niche divergence and phenotypic novelty often associated with hybrid lineages.},

abstract = {Females of two Drosophila virilis group species, D. virilis and D. montana, have different requirements for the courting males. In the present study we have examined species differences in female receptivity and male courtship song requirement using females' acceptance signal instead of copulation for measuring female readiness to mate. Behavior of D. virilis and D. montana females and F-1 and backcross hybrid females was observed in a single-pair courtships with D. virilis and D. montana males and normal and wingless (mute) F-1 hybrid males. D. virilis females were very receptive and they commonly accepted the courtship of males unable to produce courtship song. D. montana females, on the contrary, had a low receptivity and these females accepted the courting male only after hearing his song. Interspecific F-1 and backcross (BCm) females resembled D. virilis more than D. montana in their receptivity. These females, however, resembled D. montana in their song requirement. These findings suggest that female song requirement and female receptivity are determined by different genetic factors.},

abstract = {Mate recognition systems (MRSs) play a major role in sexual selection and speciation, yet few studies have analysed both male and female components in detail. Here, female preference functions have been characterized for the tettigoniid bushcricket Ephippiger ephippiger, and the inheritance of male song and female preference functions followed in crosses between subspecies. Songs are disproportionately determined by sex-linked genes. However, there is no evidence for a role of maternally derived sex-linked genes in female preference or of maternal effects. At the genetic level, there is a mismatch between peak preferences and male song, consistent with an evolutionary history of persistent directional preferences. Such a pattern of inheritance could contribute to the process of speciation via the evolution of new MRSs.},
