# Meta_F1HybridVariation

# Explore general patterns of the mean and variation of F1 hybrids in mating traits
# Conduct analogous analyses for mean and variation
# 1, general pattern of both reciprocal hybrids and parental species 
# 2, exploring the factors affecting hybrids' transgressive segregation (hybrids exceed phenotypiic range of parentals, or exceed phenotypic variation of prentals)
