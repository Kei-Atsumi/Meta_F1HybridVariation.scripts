## Folders and files

### R

Contains  

- main R script *Supplementary_material_S1.Rmd* and its html output  

- bibliography file *pheno_dist_hyb.bib*  

- citation format file *evolution.csl*  

### data

Contains  

- original data file | *original.data.xlsx*  

- datasets that parental species are alined by phenotypic means (*dat.mean.csv*), coefficient of variation (*dat.CV.csv*), variance (*dat.var.csv*) and alphabetical order (*dat.novelty.csv*)  

- calculated effect sizes for phenotypic means (*mean.ES.general.csv*) and variability (coefficient of variation - *variation.ES.general.csv* and variance - *lnVR.ES.general.csv*) to investigate dominance and crossing direction effect in phenotypic means and variabilities  

- calculated effect sizes for phenotypic means (*mean.ES.Novelty.csv*) and variability (coefficient of variation - *variation.ES.Novelty.csv* and variance - *lnVR.ES.Novelty.csv*) to investigate novelty in phenotypic means and variabilities  
- phylogenetic tree used for analyzing phenotypic means (*phylo.mean.tre*), coefficient of variation (*phylo.variation.tre*), variance (*phylo.lnVR.tre*) and link between phenotypic novelty and variability, and dominance mismatch (*phylo.Novelty.tre*)  

- picture used in large scale phylogenetic tree tip (*pic.{taxon names}.png*)
